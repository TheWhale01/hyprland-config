# Hyprland Config

This repo contains my hyprland config. I want it to be as portable as possible. 

Keep in mind that this config was created on [Fedora Linux]() so it has the best chance to work on this distro

## Dependencies

- [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- [nautilus](https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus)

## Setup

Please refer to the hyprland wiki to install hyprland:
[https://wiki.hyprland.org/](https://wiki.hyprland.org/) 

```bash
cd ~/.config/
git clone https://github.com/TheWhale01/hyprland-config.git hypr
```

log out and start an hyprland session !
